	abstract = {Multibeam Echosounder (MBES) utilizes acoustic waves emitted to the seafloor through a transmitter or transducer and records its reflective. The information obtained by MBES are depth data and the scattering value of the acoustic signal reflected by the object or the seabed, called backscatter. Acoustic backscatter can be used to classify objects or the seabed such as shipwrecks or seabed sediments. This study focuses on seabed classification using an acoustic backscatter obtained from the measurement at Alur Pelayaran Barat Surabaya (APBS). The data used in this research are acoustic backscatter from bathymetry data extraction and ground truth data of sediments. This study found the fine sand sediments with backscatter value −15.56 dB, and clayey silt sediments with backscatter value −24.36 dB. The correlations between backscatter and seabed sediments in study area were classified into four classes, clay class sediments with backscatter intensity range [(−33.81) – (−28)] dB, clayey silt class sediments with backscatter intensity range [(−27.99) – (−23)] dB, sandy silt backscatter intensity range [(−22.9) – (−18)] dB, and sand class sediments with backscatter intensity range [(−17.99) – (−10)] dB. Based on the results data are known in the study area of seabed conditions dominated by sediments type sandy silt.}
